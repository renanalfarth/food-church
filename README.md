Food Church

A simple POS system to help attendents after church service to serve people in church canteen. It uses Silex, Doctrine DBal with MySql and Twitter Bootstrap.

Actual features:

- A new order page, where the cashier can choose between plates of the menu(e.g. chesseburguer, solo french fries, soda), adding the price of the plate to the check.
- After the finish of the order, the system provides a password for the client.
- A orders page, where the kitchen workers can see the whole order from a client and a password, so they can mount the order, and deliver to the right client.
- After the deliver, it's possible to mark the order as "Delivered", so the page will hide this order and show only undelivered orders.
- Make show a counter of the number of each plate sold, to control when you have a maximum number of plates to sell.
- Create a page of the orders already delivered.

Future improvements

- Sum all the orders of a day, counting the price of the orders for the cashier to do the balance.
- Create a page to show the order number in a tablet, at the table room where the people are waiting for the order, so the client can get their order when get ready.
